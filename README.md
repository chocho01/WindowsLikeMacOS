# WindowsLikeMacOS

I use to develop on macos with intellij but for some reason I may sometimes need to work on windows.
To still be effcient, I need to preserve my favorites shortcuts and mecanism in goal to not learn it again each time I switch OS environment.
There is a list of tools and script, I used to configure my environment to feel the same as I was on mac o

## Keyboard

First thing I had to to is to buy a apple keyboard and remap key to make it compatible windows.
For that I use "Magic Utilites" soft to simplify most of the work. Then I use "Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator" to fix some keys mapping not working in my French keyboard.
You can find in this repo the source file.

## Intellij

## AutoHotKey

Then we need to install AutoHotKey for create shortcut like macos (⌘ + C, ⌘ + V, etc).
The provided script will create a lot of shortcut for OS and will also complete intellij shortcuts
